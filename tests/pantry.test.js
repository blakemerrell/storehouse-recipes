/* The pantry.
 *
 * The books were written against the storehouse order, and every ingredient
 * records whether the storehouse carried it. That is a fact about a shop, not
 * about a kitchen, and it is baked into the data. The pantry turns it into a
 * default that a household can answer over the top of, so the app is still
 * telling you the truth after you stop shopping there.
 *
 * What is worth asserting is not the list — a list of 114 things renders or it
 * does not — but that changing it actually changes what the app tells you to
 * buy, in all three places that answer that question.
