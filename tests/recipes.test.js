    /* ----------------------------------------------- chicken says when it is done

     * no time and no doneness cue anywhere in them. Three of those poached
     * chicken, cooled it and served it cold, on the words "poach the
     * chicken" alone — which is the one combination in this book that can
     * make somebody ill.
     *
     * Chicken is the one this guards, because it is the one with a number
     * everybody agrees on and the one that turns up raw most often. A recipe
     * that starts from raw chicken has to say 165°F, or say the pink is
     * gone, or hand it to a slow cooker for hours where the clock is the
     * cue. Ground beef and braises are deliberately out of scope: "brown the
     * beef" and "until it gives under a fork" are real cues in their own
     * right and a guard that argued with them would be noise. */

     * speaking of an ingredient in hand, so that meat must be on the list —
     * a gravy "for beef" or mayonnaise "in tuna" is not, and is left alone.

     * it may start cooking the meat.
