    /* ---- a comma is not a weight ------------------------------------------
     * The box was type=number, and a number input EATS a comma before any
     * script sees it: "80,5" arrived as "805", a real number that passed
     * every guard and stored eight hundred and five pounds — doubling the
     * day's calories off a seven-day average that had just moved four hundred
     * pounds. Blake does not write weights with commas, so a comma is not a
     * weight to interpret; it is a keystroke that means the entry is wrong.
     * It can only be refused if it survives to be seen, which is why the box
     * is text with a decimal keypad rather than a number.
     *
     * Typed with real keys, because the entire bug lives in what the browser
     * does to a keystroke before the value is ever read. fill() sets the
     * value directly and would prove nothing. */
