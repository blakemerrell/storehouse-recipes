/* The one-page handout at /share/.
 *
 * It is the only thing in this repository that goes out on paper into somebody
 * else's hands without either of us in the room, and it makes exactly one
 * checkable promise: every recipe on it can be made from the storehouse order
 * alone. Somebody reads that, takes the sheet home, and finds out at the stove
 * whether it was true.
 *
 * So the promise is tested rather than trusted. The eight recipes are rendered
 * out of data/recipes.js at page load, and this reads them back and asks the
 * pantry the same question the app asks — not the ingp `x` flag, which is a
 * build-time input to the pantry table and is not the same answer. That flag
 * would have waved through a smoothie built on whey protein.
 *
 * And it has to stay one sheet, printed both sides. A third side is a second
 * sheet and a different photocopying job.
