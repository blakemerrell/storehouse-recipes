/* src/sync.js against Google's Firestore emulator, through the Firebase SDK
 * the app ships and under firestore.rules as published.
 *
 * tests/fixtures/fakefire.js is a stand-in Firestore written for these tests.
 * It is fast and it is ours, which is the trouble: where it differs from the
 * real thing, a bug passes. This is the real client (the compat build of the
 * very version src/sync.js loads from gstatic) talking to the real server
 * (Google's emulator) under the real rules, so a write the rules refuse is
 * refused here, a transaction runs as one, and a snapshot carries the
 * metadata Firestore really sends.
 *
 * What is still not real: sign-in. The emulator for that is another program;
 * instead each phone's Firestore is handed a token saying who it is and how
 * it signed in (anonymously, or with an account), which is all the rules look
 * at, and sync.js is handed an auth object that answers the same. And there
 * is no IndexedDB in Node, so Firestore's offline queue lives in memory, as
 * it does in a browser that refuses persistence.
 *
 * A phone here is what fakefire's is: localStorage, a window, and its own
 * copy of sync.js, so two phones share nothing but the server. Its own copy,
 * but not its own vm context: the SDK accepts only plain objects of its own
 * realm, and an object literal made in another context has another realm's
 * Object.prototype, so every write was refused as "a custom Object object".
 * sync.js is compiled once here as a function of the globals it reads, and
 * each phone calls it with its own. */
