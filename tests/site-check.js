/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * What a built site has to be true of, checked from its files.
 *
 * Not a suite of its own — tests/offline.test.js runs it over whatever is
 * being served, or over a site it builds when the repository is being served
 * instead, and tests/upgrade.test.js leans on the same reading of a worker.
 *
 * The version used to be a number with a stamp file beside it, and the checks
 * here used to be "the stamp matches the files". There is no stamp now: the
 * version is a hash of the files, written in at build time. So the question
 * is no longer whether somebody remembered to bump it, but whether the
 * build did what it says — every URL carries the one version, the worker is
 * named for it, and the version really is the hash of the bytes that ship.
