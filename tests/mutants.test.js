/* Every mutation tools/mutate.js makes still has something to change.

 * text, and when that text is rewritten the mutation finds nothing, is
 * skipped, and says so only in the last lines of a long run. Two had gone
 * that way unnoticed (one since 29 September, one since 3 October) when this
 * was written. This reads the list and the files, with no browser, so the
 * rewrite that loses a mutation's text fails the run that makes it. */
