     One dish per meal leaves a day short. Four plates chosen to fit their own
     share land 300-odd calories under the target at every goal, and there is
     no fifth meal to put the rest in — the book has the food, the day has run
     out of slots to serve it on. Which is how anybody actually eats: the meal
     is the dish plus the thing you added to it.
   *
     So after the dishes are placed, the gap is closed with a single food
     rather than a second recipe. It is judged day-level — under and over both
     measured against what the day still has room for, the same stance
     Rebalance takes — because a topper exists to finish the day, not to fill
     a share of it. The same salt-and-fibre nudge applies, which is what keeps
     the fruit and the cottage cheese ahead of the soy sauce.
   *
     Two at most, and only onto a meal still in the future: a day topped up
     five times is not a meal plan, and adding food to a breakfast already
     eaten would be the app claiming he ate it. */

     count: one drafted day in twenty came in under 88% of its protein — the
     worst at 73% — with the calorie line sitting right on target, and the
     topper never asked. So a protein shortfall this deep earns a topper on
     its own. The fit then picks it against the protein alone, which is lean
     food (cottage cheese, chicken, egg whites, whey), and the balance that

     worth. It cleared the calorie floor, scored beautifully against a protein
     gap, and the salt-and-fibre nudge that was supposed to catch it is
     clamped at six points, because it was built to separate two dinners and
     not to veto a condiment. So the ceiling is stated outright rather than
     left to a ranking: a spoonful added to finish a day cannot carry more

     what is on the plate, and if none of the four dishes brought fibre there
     is nothing to make bigger. The day needed another thing on it.
   *
     Which is how anyone actually eats a cut — the meat, and a pile of
     vegetables beside it. So when the day comes in under the line, a side is
     added: steamed broccoli, peppers, carrots, a tomato. They cost almost
     nothing in calories, which is the whole reason this works where a fifth
