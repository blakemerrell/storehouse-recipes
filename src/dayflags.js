     That window is the right one because it is the only one anything ever
     reads. A closed-day flag is asked for exactly once, about mViewKey(), and
     a skip likewise; mRenderDay clamps that key into [mEarliestKey(),
     mLatestKey()] before it draws and mNavDay refuses to leave it. The week
     strip's filled dot is not this map at all — it is mDayDone() off the
     plates — and the review card's seven days behind read mDay(). So nothing
     on screen can want a flag from outside the window, and a flag kept past it
     is an orphan: a note that Tuesday was closed, for a Tuesday whose plates
     were pruned a fortnight ago, riding in the sync payload forever. Only
     behind: the day log keeps days past a week ahead now (a clock set back
     makes the real ones look like that — see mEditDay), and their flags stay
     with them.

     The stamps can go with them, and do (mSetSkip, mSetSend, mWriteWeight),
     because the merge refuses anything outside a part's window (`keep` in
     MSYNC_KEYED). That refusal is what has to hold, not the stamp. The
     remote document keeps every key it was ever sent — the push is a merge
     write — so before the refusal, a pruned stamp made the copy still sitting
     in Firestore look new on the next read and the pruned flag walked
     straight back in: an extra merge, save and redraw on every write, and a
     window that never held on a device with an account. Keeping the stamps
     instead would have held it, at the price of a payload announcing empty
     days forever. */

     buys NO calories: it would be the same session paid for twice, which is
     the fault this whole audit has been pulling out of the app all day. What
     it buys is WHERE the carbohydrate lands. Carb cycling picks its training
     days from an evenly-spread pattern, so somebody who says three and lifts
     Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday gets the high-carb days on Monday,
     Wednesday and Friday — every week, silently.
