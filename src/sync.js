/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Store — favorites, the weeks, and their shopping-list check-offs.
 *
 * Two modes:
 *   local   nothing configured, or no household joined. Everything lives in this
 *           browser's localStorage. Works offline, works from a file:// URL.
 *   synced  src/config.js is filled in and a household code has been entered.
 *           The same things live in one Firestore document that both phones
 *           watch, so a change on one appears on the other in about a second.
 *           localStorage still mirrors everything, so the app keeps working
 *           with no signal and catches up when it returns.
 *
 * A week is a name, seven days of recipe ids, and the ticks on the shopping
 * list it produces. There can be any number of them; one is active, and the
 * active one is what the Meal Plan and Shopping List tabs show. Which week is
 * active is shared too — the two of you are meant to be looking at one list.
 *
 * Writes are field-level on purpose: adding a recipe to Tuesday touches only
 * weeks.<id>.plan.tue, and ticking milk touches only that one key. Two people
 * editing at once do not overwrite each other.
