     Blake, logging his lunch: "the limit on the qty I can select. Is it

     nuts — his day had bacon at 4 slices, gummies at 4 pieces, hard candy at
     4 pieces and ground beef at 4 oz, every one of them sitting on the same
     ceiling. Both steppers, the plate's and the picker's, carried their own
     copy of Math.min(4, x + 0.25).
   *
     Four is a sane ceiling for a RECIPE, where x is a multiple of a serving —
     the recipe panel has scaled a dish a quarter to eight times since the app
     was built, so eight is the app's own answer to "how much of one dish is
     still a portion". It was never a ceiling for a FOOD, where x is a count
     of the thing itself: four nuts is not a snack, it is a rounding error.
   *
     A quarter is the wrong STEP for those too. You cannot eat a quarter of a
     nut, a quarter of a slice of bacon or a quarter of a gummy; you can very
     easily eat a quarter of a cup. So the countable things step by one and
     the measurable ones keep their quarters. */

     food measured by the cup, the spoon, the ounce or the pound is dialled by
     the gram: the weight is the number on the stepper, and the unit it came
     in is the chip beside it — the old arrangement turned around. A food
