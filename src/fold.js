  /* ---- My Day's readout, folding with the scroll ----

     Once the page has scrolled, the week and the four bars give way to one
     row of pills, so the card stops eating a third of a phone while you are
     down among the plates.

     It used to be a switch. At a threshold the open half was set to
     display:none and the pills appeared in its place — which is a hard
     on/off that nothing can animate, and which needed a second threshold
     lower down so that the fold and the unfold could not chase each other
     across the same line.

     It is a fraction now. `p` is how far shut the card is, taken straight
     from the scroll position: 0 at the top, 1 once you have scrolled one
     readout's worth. The card closes under the finger at the speed of the
     scroll, and since p is a pure function of scrollY — the same y always
     gives the same card — there is no threshold left anywhere for the two
     states to flap across.

     The distance is the height the fold takes out, which is what makes the
     card's bottom edge sit still: for every pixel you scroll the card loses
     a pixel, so the first plate stays glued to the underside of it the
     whole way down instead of sliding out from behind it.

     Two things make it safe to do this on every frame.

     THE PAGE MUST NOT MOVE. The height the fold takes out of the card goes
     into the card's bottom margin, so everything below keeps its page
     position and nothing has to be compensated for. Margin is the right
     place for it because margin has no background and takes no taps: the
     plates scroll up through that gap and can be read and pressed there.

     AND NOTHING IS MEASURED DURING A FRAME. The geometry is taken once,
     while the card is open and still, and every frame after that is four
     writes and no reads. Chromium's scroll anchoring answers a height
     change above the anchor by moving the scroll position; a measurement
     taken between two writes sees that compensation and reports a lie,
     which is how the old fold ended up chasing its own tail. Nothing is
     read, so there is nothing to be lied to about. */

       is a pixel of page appearing and disappearing under the finger in the
       middle of a fold. So ask the layout, not the content.
     *
       If the box happens to be clipped right now, uncover it for the reading

         is never smaller, so from then on it is ours that wins the collapse.
       *
         It has to be measured rather than read off the two margins, because
         what collapses here is not just those two — the card below hands its
         own child's top margin outward — so the space that ends up between
         them is not a number written anywhere in the stylesheet.
       *
         But it is only measurable AT THE TOP OF THE PAGE, and that guard is

         moment the page has scrolled it is pinned to the top of the screen
         and nowhere near its place in the flow, so "the distance down to the
         next card" stops being a margin and becomes most of the page. Blake
         got a blank My Day out of exactly that — a resize handler re-measured
         this while he was scrolled, and each wrong gap went into a margin
         that made the next reading wronger still: 12px became 2164px in two
         resizes, and the day became two thousand pixels of blank paper below
         the plates. A phone resizes constantly while you scroll, because iOS
         collapses the URL bar.
       *
         So: only at the top, only while none of our own inline margin is on
         the card to be read back, once, and clamped — a gap is a margin, so
