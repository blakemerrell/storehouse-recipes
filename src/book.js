   * their own than a page's text area. There is nowhere to move them to, so the
   * packer put them on a page and the printed page — which is a fixed 7.5in with
   * overflow hidden — quietly ate the difference. What went was the page number,
   * and the bottom margin with it. On screen it never showed, because a screen
   * page is min-height and simply grows.
   *
   * So: after the pages are in the document, measure each one against the paper
   * and set the overrun ones very slightly smaller until they fit. Two or three
   * percent, on two pages in a hundred and forty-two. Re-measured each time
   * rather than calculated, because shrinking type re-wraps it and the height
   * does not fall in proportion.
