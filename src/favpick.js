   *
     It is the favourite star, laid out as a grid. That is the whole trick:
     mRank already pays a favourite six points, favourites already travel to
     the other phone, and mCanFav already says any food may wear one — so a
     screen of taps improves every suggestion in the app the moment it is
     closed, with no new ranking anywhere. Blake asked for it as onboarding,
     "that way they get favorited early... and then they seed my food
     selector", and the cheapest true version of that is the star.
   *
     Chips rather than rows: you are scanning for names you recognise, not
     reading macros, and a shelf you can see all of at once is a shelf you
     answer in one look. Rows put six on a screen; this puts a category.
   *
     Truncated per shelf rather than scrolled forever, because the table runs
     past a hundred foods once the ones the storehouse does not stock are in
     it. What you have already chosen is always drawn, open or shut — a
     screen that hides your own answers is worse than a long one. */
