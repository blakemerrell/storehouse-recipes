 * wins part by part. The longer account is with the code.

 * HiveParts.daysync(app) once, as it starts. S_SYNC_STATE and

   * The household sync in sync.js shares one plan between people. This shares
   * one day between DEVICES belonging to one person, which is a different
   * promise and deserves a different door: a private code, its own document,
   * and nothing of it in the family's.
   *
   * It rides on the same collection because the rule that guards it is the
   * right rule already — a document addressed by a secret code, fetchable
   * only by someone who has the code, never listable. A second collection
   * would need those rules written again and deployed, to say the same thing.
   *
   * Every part carries the moment it was written, and days carry one each, so
   * a phone that has been in a pocket all day cannot land and wipe an evening
   * entered on the desk. Newer wins, part by part.

     on saying Synced over a day that had not been written; and the load that
