  /* ------------------------------------------------------ whose clock
   *
     Every stamp is this device's clock, and newest wins — so a device whose
     clock is wrong is wrong about everything it writes. A phone set a day
     fast won every merge for a day; one set a day slow lost every edit it
     made to the copy already on the account. Phones mostly keep good time,
     but "mostly" is a person who set theirs by hand once, and a tablet that
     has been off the network for a month.
   *
     So the clock is corrected against the server's. Each push to the
     account carries a server timestamp, labelled with this device's id;
     when the account hands it back, the difference between it and the local
     clock at the moment it was written is how far out this device is. Only
     a real error is corrected — two minutes and more — so ordinary network
     delay never moves a stamp. It is kept, so a device opened with no signal
     still stamps with what it last learned. */
