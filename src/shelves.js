     Not the same question as "which macro is this mostly", which is what
     mFoodDom answers. A shelf is where you would REACH for a thing: fruit
     and starch are both carbohydrate and you go looking for them in
     different moods, and 🥦 Veggies only means anything if it means the
     things you can eat a lot of — which is why potatoes and corn are
     shelved with the cereal.

     The first four flags win where a food has one; everything else falls
     through to whichever macro carries its calories. */

     RECIPES TOO, not just single foods. It used to return '' for anything
     without a food flag, which was every one of the 316 — so a rail built on
     it would have hidden the entire book behind any chip. A dish is shelved
     by the macro its calories come from, which is the same question
     mFoodDom answers and the only one that can be asked of a plate: there is
     no sense in which a chicken casserole is "on the vegetable shelf".
   *
     Foods get the finer answer, because a cook reaches for them differently:
     fruit and starch are both carbohydrate and you go looking for them in
     different moods.
   *
     `shelf` on the food beats the prefix lists below it. Those lists match
     the START of a key, which worked while the table was the storehouse
     order and broke the moment it grew: thirteen new fruits landed under
     Carbs because no entry began with "apple" or "grape". The lists stay for
     the storehouse keys they were written for; anything new says what it is
     instead of hoping its name starts with the right word. */

  /* Every food you can eat as it comes, under the macro it is for.

     Look up opened on a blank screen: a search box, and nothing until you
     already knew the word. The thing you want at seven in the morning is not
     a word, it is "show me the protein" — so that is what is under the box
     now, in the order a cut cares about. Protein first because it is the one
     to hit; fats last because they are what closes a plate rather than
     starts one.

     Grouped headings rather than tabs or a filter, because both of those are
     a tap to see a list that could simply have been there, and neither fills
     the empty screen that was the actual complaint.

     Ordered inside each group the way the combo's rungs are: something you
     would eat before something that goes ON food, then by how cleanly it
     carries its macro. Same rule in both places on purpose. */
