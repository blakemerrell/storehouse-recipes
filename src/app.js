  /* ------------------------------------------------------------ one search
   *
     Both searches used to be one indexOf of the whole phrase: “vanilla oat”
     found nothing — no name has those nine characters in a row — and “egg”
     put Eggplant above the Eggs you had starred: both contain it, and
     nothing said which was the one you meant. Blake: “Any word order;
     ★ and recent foods ranked first, then exact, then word-starts; common
     variants (oatmeal/oats, yoghurt/yogurt) and one-letter typos still match.
     Recipes search the same way.”
   *
     So a query is words, and every word has to find a word in the name. It
     can find it whole, or as the start of one (“oa” in oats), or inside one
     (“berr” in strawberries, which the old match found and this must not
     lose), or — for a word of four letters or more — one letter off. Words
     are compared in two forms: as typed, so the prefix of a word being typed
     still matches, and folded, so a plural, a British spelling or a variant
     name meets its twin. The grade is the weakest word's: one typo makes the

       Opening it costs something, though, and that cost went unpaid for a

           the one the day will count, or the record and the arithmetic
           disagree in the file.
