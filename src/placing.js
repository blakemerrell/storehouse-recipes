     more about it than this table knows. See the note in tools/food-db.js.

    /* Food on a meal un-skips it.
     *
       The rest of the app already assumes a skipped meal is an empty one: the
       skip button is only drawn on a meal with nothing on it, the struck-out
       line only stands in for a card with nothing on it, and Fill walks past a
       skipped meal without looking. Nothing enforced it. The chooser on the add
       sheet lists skipped meals like any other, so two taps put a plate on a
       lunch that was still marked not-happening.

       What that costs is the day itself. Every OTHER meal divides the day by
       the weights of the meals still in play, so a skipped lunch is subtracted
       from their divisor — and then paid its own share on top, out of a divisor
       that counts it. On the default weights a skipped-but-filled lunch hands
       the four cards 20/65, 25/90, 35/65 and 10/65: 128 per cent of a day, with
       every card free to say it landed on its share.

       Enforced here rather than at the doors food comes in by, because there
       are four of them — the tick on the picker, a new food saved straight onto a
       meal, Keep-these-as-one, and the pins a fresh day is seeded with — and a
       rule that has to be remembered at four doors is a rule that will be
       missed at the fifth. The food is the newer statement about the meal, so
       it wins; and mSetSkip stamps, so the un-skip travels to the other device
       instead of losing to the skip still sitting there. */

       pruned too — but the only way to have a day out there is for the
       phone's clock to have gone back, and then the "future" days are the
       real ones: set the date back ten days and the next plate logged erased
