     Rebalance does this for the whole day, where the question is "which of
     twelve plates gives way". Here the question is the one you actually have
     after putting chicken, rice and broccoli on a plate: how much of each.
     Same weights the picker fits with, same eighth-of-a-portion steps, and
     the same two exemptions — what you have eaten and what you have locked
     are not the machine's to move.
   *
     It is not only the button any more. Blake, 2026-10-05: "This needs to
     feel like magic... I see my protein is full with my egg whites. But I
     need some fat so I'm going to add some cheese... and eventually I'm going
     to have this perfect planned meal." So the sheet runs this after every
     change (mRefitMeal in app.js), with one food on the plate as well as
     several, and hands it the plate it just put down or set as `hold`: that
     one stays exactly where it went, and the rest re-fit around it.
   *
     Three ceilings came with that, and none of them is new to the app:
     a single food stops at a plateful (MFOOD_G_MAX, what the picker and the
     day's Rebalance already stop at; with no top, salsa was walked to four
     and a half cups to find carbohydrate); the meal does not run more than
     MKCAL_OVER past its calories to chase a macro ("calories win" when the
     plate cannot hit both); and salt is priced against the day's ceiling the
     way mBalanceDay prices it, MNA_W, so it stops a pile of salsa and never
     starves a meal of its protein (Blake: "Bend is fine"). */
