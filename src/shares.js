  /* What a meal is being asked for NOW, and what it was planned for.
   *
     The two are the same until something is eaten. After that they part, and
     the gap between them is the whole answer to "where did the slack go":
     eat a breakfast a thousand over and the meals still ahead are asked for
     less; leave half of it and they are asked for more.
   *
     The arithmetic is the plain one. What is LEFT is the day's targets less
     what has actually been EATEN — not less what is merely plated, because a
     dinner you have not had yet is a plan, not a fact, and a plan cannot use
     up a day. What is left is then split across the meals still to come, by
     the same weights the plan uses, so the split is the plan's own rule
     applied to a smaller day.
   *
     A finished meal keeps its PLAN as its denominator. It is history: "1,425
     against a 387 plan" is the sentence you want tomorrow, and a finished
     meal that quietly re-scored itself against the day it left behind would
     be rewriting what happened.
   *
     `spent` is the honest part. Overrun the day's carbs and every meal still
     to come is owed nought of them — and three meals printing 0/0 is true and

       protein untouched, so lunch was asked for 41 g of protein and 17 g of
       fat inside a 113 kcal budget — three hundred kcal of food in a third of
       that. The overrun was real but it was CARBS, and flooring each macro at
       nought threw that away while the calorie line still counted it.
     *
       So the calories left are the budget, and the macros are drawn from it
       in turn: protein, then fat, then whatever is still there for carbs.
       That is the order mPlanCalc builds the plan in — protein off bodyweight,
       fat to its floor, carbohydrate the remainder — so a day that has to
       shrink gives way in the reverse order it was built, and carbohydrate,
       which was the remainder, is the remainder still.

     The default is by size, never evenly. Dinner is the biggest meal, so it
     takes the biggest share of a surplus and gives up the most of a debt, and
     every meal moves by the same PROPORTION. Split evenly, 260 spare calories
