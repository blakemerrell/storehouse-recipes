     Undershoot is judged against the meal's share and overshoot against the
     DAY's remaining, which is right for the day and blind for the meal: at
     breakfast, with nothing eaten yet, one dish can claim all of the day's
     protein and be charged nothing for it. The ranking did exactly that — it
     offered three servings of a 271 kcal plate, 813 kcal, for a meal whose
     share was 381.

     Nobody asked the app for that and it is where a lot of overeating starts:
     not a plan gone wrong later, a number too big when it was first put in
     front of you. So a portion may run over its share, because meals are not
     equal and the day still has to be filled — but not without limit.

     1.15 is measured, not chosen: swept over 600 seeded days at 1.15 / 1.25 /
     1.35 / 1.5 / 1.75 / 2.0 against no cap at all. It gives the best meal
     balance (meals off their share 813 -> 427 kcal), better protein than no
     cap (5.3 -> 4.8 g), and a third as many oversized plates as the next
     setting up. It costs about 16 kcal a day of precision on the day's total,
     which is the honest price of not stuffing the day through one meal.

     Only the SUGGESTION is bound. mBalanceDay does its own sizing against the
     whole day and is deliberately left alone: it is what lets the day still
     reach its protein, and constraining it costs about 14 g a day, which is
     measured and not worth it. */
