         as decoration under a line of text.

         copy clipped at exactly the eaten edge — which is the only way a
         figure sitting on a partial fill stays legible at both ends. Clipped
         at `wAte` rather than at the end of the whole fill, because the
         planned band and the assumed hatching are both pale and ink is what
         reads on those.

         Two bands, not three. Solid is eaten, pale is planned — food and
