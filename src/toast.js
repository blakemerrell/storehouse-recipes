     The toast used to be built by its own first message, role=status and
     all, and a live region that arrives WITH its words is a region nobody
     was listening to yet: a screen reader announces changes to a region it
     already knows about, so the first "won't be suggested" of a session was
     never read out, and every one after it was. The box that is drawn comes
     and goes with `hidden`; the words go to a region that is always there
     and never drawn, so the voice does not depend on the paint. */
