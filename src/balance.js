     pen() priced four things — protein, fat, carbohydrate and salt — and all
     four are day-level. Nothing in it said where the food should land, so a
     day could put a seven-calorie plate on the last meal and a thousand on
     dinner and score as a perfect day. On a plan shaped like Blake's, over
     fourteen consecutive days, the evening snack came in at 0.59 of its share
     and was a token on thirteen of them: a quarter of a churro and two bell
     peppers, on a day that still finished two hundred under. Meals draft in
     order, and by the last slot the asymmetric weights — over at 1.2, under
     at 0.55 — make leaving calories on the table cheaper than overshooting.
   *
     Priced against the meal's own ask, read off mMealAsk so this and the
     meal's pills agree about the same meal, and normalised on the day's
     calories so a 150-kcal snack and an 800-kcal dinner get the same rule.
     Symmetric, because a 90-kcal snack and a 1,000-kcal dinner are one fault
     seen from either end.

     One, measured on Blake's own plan over fourteen consecutive days rather
     than on the bench, whose default profile is an extreme cut and whose
     knee sat at two. On his plan two bought one fewer token evening than one
     did and paid four grams of protein and twenty-five calories a day for it;
     one took the evening snack from 0.59 of its share to 0.86, cleared every
     oversized plate, and moved day accuracy by one calorie. */

     Fill is an offer to build out the empty meals. It was also quietly
     resizing the full ones: a hand-placed 1,139 kcal pulled beef put on
     dinner at one serving came back at ×0.25 after a single press, and the
     day then read 184/180 P in green while being some 850 kcal wrong. The
     day's arithmetic was right — the plate was not the plate you put down.
   *
     Nothing here can tell whose a plate is, because nothing was recording it:
     every free-list frees whatever is neither eaten nor locked, and Fill's
     plates and yours are the same shape. So Fill now signs its own work and
     asks only for that back. Note the DEFAULT is unsigned, which means a day
     drafted before this shipped reads as entirely hand-placed — the safe
     direction, since the cost is a solver with less to move rather than a
     portion silently overwritten.
   *
     Rebalance is deliberately NOT narrowed, here or in mBalanceMeal. Pressing
