         This check used to sit inside the loop and read the day's remaining

         nearly half of all runs, and pressing Fill again sometimes filled it,
         which is the tell — nothing about that meal had changed.

         Those dishes were never final. Every one of them is resized by
         mBalanceDay a few lines down; the draft overshoots by design, and its
         own comment says so. Refusing a meal over a portion that has not been
         settled yet is refusing it over a number that does not exist.

         What does justify refusing is a day already accounted for — press Fill
         at nine at night with everything logged and it should add nothing. So
