  /* ------------------------------------------------------- when a meal is
   *
     Meals have never had times: a meal is a name, a kind and a share, and the
     order you put them in. But "is this meal happening yet" is a question the
     day has to answer twice now — whether food added to it was eaten, and
     whether today is far enough along to be judged — and both want a clock.
     So each kind carries the hour its meal opens, and a meal of no fixed kind
     takes its time from where it sits between the ones that have one.
   *
     A little early rather than late, because at a meal's own hour the usual
     act is logging it, not planning it: a breakfast added at half six is
     breakfast, and a lunch added at quarter past eleven is almost always lunch
     being eaten. Either way a wrong guess is one tap on the tick to put
     right. */
