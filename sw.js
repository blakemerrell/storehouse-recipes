 * Service worker — so the app opens with no signal.
 *
 * Firestore already keeps the data offline. What it could not do was hand you
 * the app itself: tapping the icon on a home screen in a storehouse basement
 * meant a browser error page, because index.html, the stylesheet, the scripts
 * and the recipes all had to come off the network first. They are cached here.
 *
 * Three rules, because they answer different questions:
 *
 *   the page itself   network first, cache as a fallback. Online, you always
 *                     get the current index.html, so a deployment lands on the
 *                     very next load. Offline, you get the last one that worked.
 *   a versioned file  from the cache, and nothing else. Its URL carries the
 *                     build (?v=), so the copy under that URL cannot be out of
 *                     date — a new build is a new URL. Fetching it again on
 *                     every open to find it identical was a dozen requests and
 *                     two and a half megabytes of cache writes a load, for
 *                     nothing.
 *   everything else   cache first, and quietly fetch a fresh copy afterwards
 *                     for next time. Nothing waits on the network.
 *
 * Anything not on this origin — the Firebase SDK, Firestore itself — is left
 * alone entirely and goes straight to the network, where the SDK's own offline
 * handling takes over.

/* Which build this is. Nobody types it: tools/build-site.js writes it in when
   it builds the site for deployment, as a hash of the files it covers — the
   shell, the scripts, the data and this worker — so the same files always come
   out as the same version and different files never do.
 *
   It used to be a number bumped by hand, and that was two problems. A bump
   forgotten left phones on the old files indefinitely, which reached main
   eleven times. And two branches cut from one commit both picked the next
   number, so every merge conflicted on ten lines of index.html and eleven of
   this file that nobody had meant to change.
 *
   '0' is what the repository itself says, before a build. A worker served
   straight from the files — a local server, or Pages still set to deploy from
   the branch — knows it is unbuilt and behaves as one: see DEV below. Zero
   rather than a word, for the sake of the workers already on phones: they
   read a page's version as digits, and a page with no digits there looks to
   them like a page with no version at all, which they would keep over the
   one that works. */
