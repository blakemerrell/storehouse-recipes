/* The security rules as SETUP.md asks somebody to paste them: firestore.rules
 * without its comments.
 *
 * SETUP.md said its copy was "the same as firestore.rules in this repository,
 * without the comments", and on 4 October it was not: it was a hand copy from
 * before named(), so a household set up from it let anonymous visitors fill
 * the members list, and checked dinner numbers more loosely. Now the copy is
 * made from the file, and tests/setuprules.test.js fails when they part.
 *
 *     node tools/setup-rules.js     # rewrite the block in SETUP.md
