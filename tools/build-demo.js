/*
 * The pictures the landing page animates through.
 *
 * Both halves are real. The book frames are pages lifted out of the rendered
 * PDF; the app frames are the app itself, driven at phone size and
 * photographed. Nothing here is a mockup, which matters more than it sounds:
 * a landing page that shows a drawing of a product is making a claim it has
 * not checked, and this one regenerates from the current build every time.
 *
 * It replaced a strip of twelve engravings. Those were the best thing on the
 * page and they are still in it — one of the book frames is a section opener,
 * so the art appears where it belongs instead of in a gallery of its own.
 *
 * WebP at quality 82. The strip it replaced was 2.6 MB of PNG for pictures a
 * reader scrolled past; this is eight frames at roughly a tenth of that, and
 * they are the argument rather than the decoration.
 *
 * Run:  node tools/build-demo.js
 * Needs: print/Hive-and-Hearth-Recipes.pdf, pdftoppm, pdftotext and pdfinfo
 *        (poppler-utils), playwright, sharp.
