/*
 * Mutation testing — the only honest answer to "is this test any good?".
 *
 * A green suite says nothing on its own. It says the code passes the tests,
 * not that the tests would notice if the code were wrong. So this breaks
 * something a person actually depends on, runs the lot, and asks whether
 * anything went red. A mutation that survives is a gap: the suite believes it
 * is asserting a rule and is in fact asserting an example that happens to be
 * true either way.
 *
 * Twelve of these were run over the suite. Eight were caught. Four were not:
 *
 *   esc() stops escaping            nothing tested escaping at all
 *   flagged seasonings unmarked     the test checked the foot and the lines
 *                                   agreed, and they agreed about nothing
 *   the cache name stops moving     the name and the asset version were free
 *                                   to drift, and already had, by one
 *   a week planned on the wrong day  the remote write path, which the default
 *                                   run cannot reach — see tests/sync.test.js
 *
 * The first three are covered now, each verified by running its own mutation
 * again and watching it fail. The fourth is a boundary rather than an
 * oversight and is left standing on purpose: every remote write rests on
 * tests/sync.test.js, which needs a network and is not in the default run.
 *
 * Run: node tools/mutate.js   (about two minutes per mutation)
 * Every mutation is written to the file and restored in a finally, so an
 * interrupted run leaves the tree as it found it. Check `git status` after.
