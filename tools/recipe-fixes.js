 * Corrections applied to the original recipe text at build time.
 *
 * The originals in design/project/ are left exactly as they arrived. Anything
 * that needed changing is listed here instead, so it is obvious what was
 * altered and why, and so a corrected original can be dropped in later without
 * unpicking edits made in place.
 *
 * All eighteen entries below are the same problem: a recipe that cooks raw
 * chicken and never says how to know it is done. Two of them are worse — the
 * ingredient list says "cooked" or "shredded" chicken but no step ever cooks
 * it, so following the recipe literally puts raw chicken into a casserole.
 *
 * 165°F is the USDA figure for poultry.
 *
 * The nineteenth is a different kind of wrong, and uses `set` rather than
 * `add`: the step is replaced instead of appended to. No. 006 said "whisk in
 * dry milk powder until dissolved", into a cup of yogurt. It does hydrate —
 * a cup of yogurt is around 200 g of water and two tablespoons of powder is
 * under nine — but tipped in it clumps, and "until dissolved" promises
 * something that does not happen in anything that thick. The six warm drinks
 * added later all turn on the same technique, so the fix is the one they use.
 *
 * The last group is not a correction at all. Ten recipes call for a bottle of
 * barbecue sauce or a packet of gravy mix, neither of which the storehouse
 * carries and both of which it has every part of. Recipes 264 and 265 are those
 * two, and these entries are the cross-reference from the recipes that want
 * them. Nine of the ten are here; the tenth is No. 247, which was written for
 * this collection rather than carried over, so it is edited in place instead.

  /* ---- five recipes you could not follow ------------------------------
   * Three of them list flour, baking powder, milk and butter and then never
   * touch any of it: "Make biscuit dough" is not a method, it is the name of
   * one. Two more say "make quick pancake cornbread flatbread on skillet",
   * which names three different breads in one sentence and gives no liquid,
   * no pan and no heat.
   *
   * The cornbread is also not cornbread. There is no cornmeal in pancake mix
   * and none on the order list. What the storehouse does have is canned corn,
   * so these are now a corn skillet bread that actually contains corn — the
   * honest version of what the title was already promising, and better beside
   * a bowl of chili than a plain pancake would be.
   *
   * The biscuit ratio is the same in all three, because it is the same dough:
   * 2 cups flour, 1 tbsp baking powder, 4 tbsp butter, ¾ cup milk. Rubbed in
   * cold and barely mixed, which is the whole difference between a drop
   * biscuit and a scone.

   * the meat. Only the first has an obvious drop-in replacement. The others get
   * told to cook in plain water and make the gravy from what is in the pot at
   * the end, which is what the packet was standing in for anyway.

   *
   * Found by a reader looking at No. 084 and asking where the rice crisp

   * and contain cinnamon. A casserole named for rotini that is made with the
   * ribbon pasta the storehouse actually carries.

   * missing things — crisp rice cereal, buttermilk, marshmallows, rotini — is
   * on the storehouse order, and the promise this book makes is that its
   * recipes come off that order. Adding them to keep four titles would break

   *
   * Reported by the owner after cooking No. 190, the alfredo bake. He was
   * confused by the cheese sauce, went and asked elsewhere how to make one,
   * and came back with a better dish than the book describes.
   *
   * Four separate faults in that one recipe, and the same shape underneath
   * all of them: the recipe knows what it wants and does not say it.
   *
   *   - "Whisk evaporated milk, butter, and cheese into sauce" is one line
   *     doing four jobs. No heat, no order, no thickener, no cue for done.
   *     Cheddar whisked into evaporated milk with nothing starchy stays thin
   *     or splits, which is exactly what happened.
   *   - There was not enough of it. Two cups of sauce for a pound of dry
   *     pasta and two pounds of chicken, where a baked pasta wants twice
   *     that, and then twenty minutes in the oven takes more.
   *   - Parmesan is on the shopping list for this recipe and appears in no
   *     ingredient line and no step. He added it himself, on top, which is
   *     where it belongs and where the recipe should have said.
   *   - The pasta is cooked twice: boiled to done, then baked for twenty
   *     minutes more.
   *
   * The other ten are the third fault on its own — an ingredient the reader
   * is told to buy and then never told to use. Taco seasoning in five,
   * garlic powder and Italian seasoning in one, cumin, Worcestershire, and
   * parmesan again in the meatball feast.
   *
   * This is the green bean problem in a different field. The guard written
   * for that one reads the ingredient list; "buy this elsewhere" is a
   * separate list, so none of these was ever covered. tests/recipes.test.js
   * now reads both.
   *
   * None of the eleven can be made from the order — the storehouse carries
   * salt, celery salt, cinnamon and cinnamon sugar, and no other seasoning at
   * all — so every one of them stays an extra. What changes is that the
   * method now says where it goes and how much.

  /* ---- No. 235, reported by the owner as confusing -----------------------
   *
   * He was right, and it is confusing for four separate reasons.
   *
   * "Mix cake batter in 9x13 dish" — out of what? The ingredient list is a
   * box of cake mix, a packet of pudding mix and hot water. A boxed mix wants
   * eggs, oil and water of its own, none of which is listed, so the first
   * real instruction cannot be carried out at all. Same fault as No. 205's
   * cheese sauce: the recipe knows what it means and never says it.
   *
   * Then it tells you to pour two cups of hot water over a dish of cake
   * batter, which looks like a mistake, and does not say the one thing that
   * makes it not a mistake: this is a self-saucing pudding. The water and the
   * dry pudding mix sink while the cake rises through them, and what comes
   * out is cake on top and hot fudge underneath. Nobody who has not seen it
   * before will believe the instruction without being told why.
   *
   * It also does not say DO NOT STIR, which is the one way to ruin it, and it
   * gives no doneness cue for a dish whose whole point is that the middle
   * stays liquid — so "until a skewer comes out clean" would be exactly wrong
   * and thirty minutes is the only guidance offered.
   *
   * And it is called Bowls, makes "6 Bowls", and never portions anything into
   * a bowl.

  /* ---- six recipes that say "rice" and mean cooked rice -----------------

   * The method is what settles it, not a guess: all six say "cooked rice" in
   * a step, and No. 51 spells the quantity out — "½ cup cooked rice" into

   * ingredient line says once it says which it means.

   * Not applied to the other seven recipes that charge dry rice. Two of them
   * boil it in the method and five give no instruction either way, and dry is

  /* ---- name the pan, and say what lines it ------------------------------
   *
   * Blake, cooking from the printed book: "How big is a pan for this recipe?
   * Line with what?" No. 331 said "press into a lined square pan" and never
   * answered either question. Nineteen recipes named a vessel with no size
   * anywhere in them, and three said "lined" without saying what with, which
   * is the word that decides whether the slab comes out in one piece.
   *
   * Sized by what actually goes in rather than by the serving count: an
   * 8-inch square is 412 cm2 of floor, a 9-inch 524, a 9x13 dish 756, a 9x5
   * loaf 291, and two to four centimetres deep is the band a bake cooks
   * through evenly. No. 328 already did this properly, buttering the pan and
   * lining it with a strip of parchment hanging over two sides, and it is the
   * model the rest of these follow. */

Dry chicken is a method problem, not a chicken problem.","Cook the tomatoes down hard with the onion until they thicken into something closer to a sauce than a salad.","Spoon the tomato over the rice, the chicken over that, and the oregano and pepper on top.","Eaten cold or warmed, and better warmed if you have the option."]},

  {"id":309,"steps":["Pound the thick end of the chicken level. Brown it hard on both sides in a dry pan and set it aside; it finishes in the sauce. Even thickness is what stops the thin end drying out while the thick end catches up.","Cook the sliced onion in the same pan until it softens, then add the tomatoes in quarters and cook them down until they collapse into something you would call a sauce.","Drain and rinse the green beans — rinsing takes a fair part of the tin’s salt down the sink with it — and stir them in with the oregano and basil.","Chicken back in, lid on, low for 10 to 15 minutes, until it reads 165°F at the thickest part, then the pepper.","Fresh tomatoes make the sauce and the tin only supplies the beans, which is the way round that keeps the salt where a cut can afford it."]},

  {"id":312,"steps":["Slice the chicken thin across the grain, pat it dry, and toss it with the ginger, the garlic powder and the pepper.","Get the oil smoking in the widest pan you have and cook the chicken in two batches, leaving it alone until the underside is brown before turning it. Wet chicken steams; dry chicken browns.","Broccoli in small florets and the pepper in strips go in next with the water, lid on for two minutes to steam them, then lid off to drive the water away.","Chicken back in, tossed through until it is hot and no pink remains at the centre.","A stir-fry with no soy sauce, because a tablespoon of it is close to half a day’s salt on a cut.
