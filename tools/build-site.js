/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The site as it is served, built from the repository into _site/.
 *
 *     node tools/build-site.js               _site/, minified
 *     node tools/build-site.js --no-minify   the same, with every comment kept
 *     node tools/build-site.js <dir>         somewhere else
 *
 * GitHub Pages used to serve the repository itself, straight off main, and the
 * version that gets a phone off its cached copy was a number kept in the files:
 * ?v=N on ten lines of index.html, eleven of sw.js and the cache name, bumped
 * by tools/bump-version.js. That had two faults, and they were the same fault.
 * Forget the bump and phones keep the old app with nothing to say so — it
 * reached main eleven times. Remember it on two branches cut from the same
 * commit and both pick N+1, so every merge conflicted on twenty-odd lines that
 * nobody had meant to change. A number in the files is a number somebody has
 * to keep, and two people keep it differently.
 *
 * So the files carry a placeholder, ?v=0, and this writes the real version in
 * on the way out: a hash of every file the service worker holds as the app,
 * the worker included. It is computed rather than chosen, so the same files
 * always give the same version — two branches that end up identical agree
 * without talking — and changed files always give a new one, so there is
 * nothing to forget. The deploy workflow runs this and publishes _site/;
 * the repository never sees the number at all.
 *
 * What ships is only what the site serves. The 105 MB of source engravings,
 * the tests and tools, the design archive and the generated preview all
 * stayed in the repository and all went out with every deploy; they do not
 * now. The scripts, the data, the worker and the stylesheet go out with their
 * comments stripped — this codebase explains itself at length, which is right
 * for somebody reading it and a cost for a phone on one bar of signal. The
 * repository keeps every word.
 *
 * Run the suite against what this produces with `npm run test:site`, which is
 * what CI does and what the deploy does before it publishes anything.
