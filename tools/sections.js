/*
 * Run and Not Be Weary, re-sectioned.
 *
 * The book shipped in four sections named after how the food was made —
 * Zero-Cook, Morning Brews, Batch Preps, Cut Snacks. That is the author's
 * view. Somebody standing in a kitchen at six in the evening has a different
 * question, and it is always the same one: what am I eating now. So the
 * sections are meals and moments instead, and the four old names go.
 *
 * "Brews" in particular was doing badly. It meant the Crio Bru drinks, and it
 * sat over nineteen recipes that are eggs, oats and pancakes — so the one
 * word on the divider named the smallest thing behind it.
 *
 * Nothing is rewritten here except sixteen servings lines, below. Every recipe
 * keeps its number, its ingredients, its method and its score; what changes is
 * which divider it sits behind. Like recipe-fixes.js, this leaves the export in
 * design/project/ untouched and keeps the change legible in one file.
 *
 * The seven, and what each is for:
 *
 *   Breakfasts        the morning food, with the drinks taken out
 *   Snacks            small, cold, no cooking — from both old halves
 *   Lunch             the cold assemblies that are a meal, not a handful
 *   Dinner            cooked tonight, eaten tonight
 *   Best Before Bed   cottage cheese, puddings, a warm mug. Slow protein and
 *                     nothing that will keep you up
 *   Power Drinks      the Crio Bru brews, the shakes, the smoothies
 *   Batch Prep        cook once, eat the week: slow-cooker, sheet-pan, the
 *                     six-container ones
 *
 * Sizes are deliberately uneven. Snacks is the biggest because that is what
 * the collection actually holds, and padding a section to make a contents page
 * look tidy would be arranging the book around the furniture.

   * always preferred over the id and which nothing has ever set — carries the

 * And then numbered, both volumes, straight through.
 *
 * Volume One was renumbered when it was re-sectioned and Volume Two was not,

 * one page earlier promises a number "running from 001 straight through both
